## 🌟 Features

- **Radiance for All Enemies**: 
  - Applies the Radiance effect to every enemy in the level, randomly altering their health, speed, and damage between 1x and 10x.

## 🚧 Limitations

- **Aura Persistence**: 
  - Enemies that have been excluded from the Radiance effect via the configuration menu will still retain their visual Radiance aura. However, this is purely aesthetic, and the excluded enemies will not have modified attributes.

2. **In-Game Configuration**:
   - Powered by **Configgy**, the mod offers a user-friendly interface to:
     - Enable or disable the mod.
     - Select specific enemy types to include or exclude from the Radiance effect.
